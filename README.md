Apparently not everyone likes it when you show a technical demo
of using their API or write a library and a getting started guide
to help their users... yikes!

> I want to be very clear that I didn't post any "hacks" of any kind, nor did I post anything material to any type of "hacker" site. Everything that I had posted was educational in nature for the purpose of helping others get started using the API, with all intentions of such access being done in a legal and proper way.
>
> That said, I had posted material on 3 sites for professional web developers and that material has been removed.
>
> The rest of those results are simply junk chinese syndicate sites (i.e. [junk site link removed]) for which I have no affiliation, communication, account, or knowledge.
>
> It doesn't appear that any of those junk sites have actual copies of content on them, so as their caches expire and they re-scrape the web those references will disappear.

*Note*: The technical demo and library in question (which most companies would gratefully link to as 3rd party library) was added to github on October 17th 2010.
